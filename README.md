## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Burak Fatih
### Who Am I?
In addition to the control, design and drawing of the electronic circuit boards produced within the company, the realization of the test stages, the integration of the produced systems and the control of the produced devices, I also conducted R&D studies within the scope of power electronics. . In terms of personal development, I also worked on embedded software development with STM32 & Atmega microprocessor. Now that I want to focus more on the software field that interests me and I want to work in the sector intensively, I chose to focus on the software field.
